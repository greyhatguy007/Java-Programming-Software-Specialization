    <h3>add Images</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Next, add images to your "My Interests" page. Consider adding images that represent items you added to your original page. You should use what you know about the <img> tag in HTML. You can use your own images or find some images online. Wikimedia
            Commons (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and Pixabay (https://pixabay.com) are two great resources, but there are many, many more! You will need to host your images somewhere online. Learners have suggested the following image
            hosting sites for this course. Please note that Imgur (http://imgur.com/) cannot be used for hosting images on CodePen. If you try using Imgur, your images will likely not be displayed on CodePen for long.
