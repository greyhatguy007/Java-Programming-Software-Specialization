        <h2> Metadata Tags </h2>
        <p>
            Because CodePen is a tool for creating websites, it is already creating several metadata tags for you, including the html, head, title, and body tags. To see these metadata tags for your post, click Export >> Export .zip in the lower right hand corner
            of your Pen, as seen here.

        <p>Begin by giving your Pen a custom name at the top of the Pen, then follow the steps outlined below. Remember to frequently save your work! If you need help remembering how to write out the tags shown in the last video, visit our documentation
            page, linked in the <strong>Resources</strong> tab.</p>
        <li>
            <p> <strong>Add at least 2 divs</strong>. Remember that divs will later be used to style different parts of your web page differently (e.g., having different text font, color, or size, or a different background color for the web page content between
                the div tags).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Add at least one header </strong>within a div tag. Play around with different header sizes (e.g., h1, h2 â€¦ h6).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Add at least one paragraph </strong>within a div tag.</p>
        </li>

        <h3> Some Tips: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>All HTML code is between <b> html </b>tags.</li>
            <li>Your Pen name is included between the <b>title</b>tags.</li>
            <li>All of the HTML you wrote for your web page is between the <b>body</b> tags. </li>
            <li>If you were building an HTML web page without CodePen, you would need to write these metadata tags for yourself.</li>
        </ol>
