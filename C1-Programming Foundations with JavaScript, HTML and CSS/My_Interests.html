        <h2> Metadata Tags </h2>
        <p>
            Because CodePen is a tool for creating websites, it is already creating several metadata tags for you, including the html, head, title, and body tags. To see these metadata tags for your post, click Export >> Export .zip in the lower right hand corner
            of your Pen, as seen here.

        <h3> Some Tips: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>All HTML code is between <b> html </b>tags.</li>
            <li>Your Pen name is included between the <b>title</b>tags.</li>
            <li>All of the HTML you wrote for your web page is between the <b>body</b> tags. </li>
            <li>If you were building an HTML web page without CodePen, you would need to write these metadata tags for yourself.</li>
        </ol>
